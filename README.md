# JSweet examples

A set of simple examples to show what can be done with the JSweet transpiler (https://github.com/cincheo/jsweet).

All these example are written in Java using the JSweet APIs (candies). They are then transpiled to JavaScript by the JSweet transpiler.

- Simple canvas drawing: demonstrates the use of HTML5 canvas.
- Simple HTML form control: demonstrates the use of HTML5 forms and inputs.
- Simple jQuery: demonstrates the use of JQuery with JSweet.
- Simple Angular: demonstrates the use of Angular with JSweet.
- Ray tracer: draws a 3D scene, adapted from the TypeScript example page.
- Todos: demonstrates the use of Backbone and Underscore with JSweet, adapted from the TypeScript example page.
- Blocks game: demonstrates how to write an HTML5 mobile game with JSweet.
- Promises: demonstrates the use of the latest EcmaScript6 Promise API.

Visit the live JSweet's example page (http://www.jsweet.org/examples) to browse the examples, run them and debug the Java code within your favorite browser. Note that all these examples are responsive and should work as well on a Web browser and on a mobile.
